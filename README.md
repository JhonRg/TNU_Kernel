The TNU Kernel
====
The TNU (Terminal is Not Unix) is a fork of the Linux kernel for learning inspired the construction of a UNIX core and POSIX compatible.

Goals we want to achieve with the construction of this kernel:

        Create a Hybrid-Kernel, basaed of linux.
        Easy read the code source.
        Stable kernel and functional.                                                                 
        Run to Intel MMX of the maximus rending.
        Deveploving the Panic UI.
        Deveploving the "Avanced Loggin System" (ALS).
        Deveploving the "Avanced Security Modules" (ASM) (PAM or SELinux).
        Root's User of the kernel.
        POSIX:2008 and UNIX 03 Standard.
